# About


OSM2VectorTiles.org (launching today) is a project simplifying installation of free world maps maintained by OpenStreetMap community. It offers freely downloadable OSM vector tiles, and a set of open-source tools to use them and generate them.

Within minutes anybody can run on a laptop or private server his own copy of OpenStreetMap map, with a customised design and use it websites and mobile applications or in intranet - even behind a firewall or without internet connection.
