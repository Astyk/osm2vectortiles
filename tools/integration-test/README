# integration-test

Integration test for entire OSM2VectorTiles workflow.
Primary purpose is to verify that everything works together
not to verify correctness.

Take a look at the `.travis.yml` file to see how it is called.
The setup requires a working S3 endpoint to test the distributed
workflow.
