# Public CDN from Klokan Technologies

Klokan Technologies provides a free and fast CDN for delivering the Open Streets vector tiles for development purposes and testing.

The free CDN service is not recommended for production use in mobile or web applications and commercial use is prohibited without permission. The service is made for demonstration of the open-source technology developed in this project and for designers, but should not be used on servers or in any final products.

Anybody can with a few simple steps easily <a href="/docs/start/">host his own map tiles</a> on a standard virtual server or contact us or other map tile providers.

## Using the Service

The demo tile server address is: <a href="http://osm2vectortiles.tileserver.com/v1.json" target="_blank">http://osm2vectortiles.tileserver.com/v1.json</a>
