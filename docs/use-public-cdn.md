# Public CDN from Klokan Technologies

Klokan Technologies provides a free and fast CDN for delivering the
vector tiles to your applications.
This service is freely available for all developers to use.

## Using the Service

A [public and fast vector tile server](http://osm2vectortiles.tileserver.com/v1.json)
is publicly available for everyone to use for free without any restrictions.

However if you create real application we ask you
kindly to [create a free access key](http://maps.klokantech.com/)
and use the vector tiles together with the access keys so we can guarantee the performance of the service.
