Download [Mapbox Studo Classic](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/) to create your first map.

# Create new style

Create a new style project based of OSM Bright. You can also start with a blank slate but it is easier
to get started from an existing style.

In `Styles and Resources` create a new style and choose `OSM Bright 2`. Then save your project.
