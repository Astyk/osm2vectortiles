# FAQ

## Can I use the OSM Vector Tiles for commercial purposes?

We want to push vector tiles and enable every developer to create great looking map applications.
The workflow to produce MBTiles is MIT licensed which allows you to create your own vector tiles
and use and sell them commercially. The vector tile data provided on the download page is licensed CC BY-SA.
Because the data is from OpenStreetMap [you also need to credit OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)
and add the attribution "Â© OpenStreetMap contributors".

## Will the extracts and planet file be updated with new OSM data?

We plan to provide at least quarterly updates of the open vector tile data.

## Where should I report bugs in the map?

Please report any bugs you experience on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/osm2vectortiles/osm2vectortiles/issues).

## How can I contribute to the project?

Please report any bugs you experience on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/osm2vectortiles/).

## Can I use my custom base map in other GIS tools? (QGIS, Esri, ...)

The Mapbox Vector Tile Specification is [planned to be implemented by Esri into ArgGIS](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2015/07/20/vector-tiles-preview/).
The Geometa Lab is working on a QGIS plugin to support vector tiles.

## What is the future Roadmap of this Project?

We are willing to support this project in the future and provide it with
regular updates. The roadmap is public and we welcome you to contribute
on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/osm2vectortiles/osm2vectortiles/issues).
