# FAQ

## Can I use the OSM Vector Tiles for commercial purposes?

We want to push vector tiles and enable every developer to create great looking map applications.
The workflow to produce MBTiles is MIT licensed which allows you to create your own vector tiles
and use and sell them commercially. The vector tile data provided on the download page is licensed CC BY-SA.
Because the data is from OpenStreetMap [you also need to credit OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)
and add the attribution "Â© OpenStreetMap contributors".

## Will the extracts and planet file be updated with new OSM data?

## Where should I report visual errors in the map?

## How can I contribute to the project?

## Can I use my custom base map in other GIS tools? (QGIS, Esri, ...)
